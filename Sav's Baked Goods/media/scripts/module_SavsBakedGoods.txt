    /** QUESTIONS
    What do Packaged and FoodType do?
    If only WorldStaticModel is set we don't need StaticModel?
    Also, there's a Tags attribute, should i tag stuff?


    I want to figure out how to set once set of calories and stats when raw, and another when cooked.
    Do i want to be using `RemoveNegativeEffectOnCooked = TRUE`, or changing the item? with `ReplaceOnCooked = *`?
        Hopefully i won't have to use the `replaceoncooked` setting too much?

    Learned
        Add type=drainable to items that get items, and a usedelta.
        usedelta is a percentage of the item?
        when used in a recipe, the number represented is a single `delta` worth of usage?
